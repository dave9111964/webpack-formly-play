# webpack-formly-play
A playground that I use to perform proof of concepts combining Webpack, AngularJS 1.4, and AngularJS 2.0 technologies.

This application makes use of Webpack to maintain a loose coupling and modularity.  This application bootstraps both an AngularJS 1.4 and an AngularJS 2.0 app on the same page.

For the AngularJS 1.4 portion I've used Angular-Formly.  I believe this will make conversion from AngularJS 1.X simplier, as Angular-Formly has many simularity to AngularJS 2.0 FormBuilder.
